Given an array ```nums``` of n integers and an integer ```target```, find three integers in ```nums``` such that the sum is closest to ```target```. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

**Example:**
```
Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.

The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```
